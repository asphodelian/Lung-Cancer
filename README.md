# Overview
Welcome! This is a continuation of the summer 2023 TCR-Project. Time had ran out to properly dive into the lung cancer dataset, so it will be explored here in this repository. We'll still be looking at the vj genes of these lung cancer patients, and we'll be using the same techniques used in the TCR-Project.
